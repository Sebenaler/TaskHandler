# TaskHandler
Task Handler for things I need to do. 

There is going to be a personal project where I create a task handler. You can create tasks you need to do. See completed tasks. A calendar with when tasks are due. A section that shows the most important things. This is just for fun. I am using this as a learning tool.

Python and Pygame
